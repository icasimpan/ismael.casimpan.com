      <description>I had my first raspberry pi way back 2015 but I never get to use it. Back then, that single-board computer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a built-in wireless interface. Past forward 2020 and I bought a new PI on Lazada without checking on the specs&amp;hellip;so I got a wifi dongle as well.
My pi arrived first and after thoroughly reading the specs, I laughed at myself for buying something that I may never need.</description>
