      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s official: IBM is indeed buying RedHat. I&amp;rsquo;m an pro-Open Source and RedHat (and derivative OS such as CentOS) is my favorite but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything bad from it. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that the enterprise world that IBM represents some several decades ago is now taking in RedHat (a huge Open Source advocate AND backer) as it&amp;rsquo;s own.
Whether open source or closed source, any business would need to be in a good financial capacity in order to move forward.</description>
