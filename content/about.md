Currently employed as Technical Specialist in a Japanese-owned agency under the ITO Division. Previously worked as System Administrator (~4 years) and Software Build Engineer(7+ years) and very much proficient in git, subversion and jenkins. My direct sysadmin experience totals about 10years+ and codes mostly in shell(bash) and distilled in my open source [Shell Scripting Development Kit and framework - ShCF](https://ismael.casimpan.com/shcf/). Been proficient in Perl but my skills on it has been rusty lately due to unuse. I could read a python code but don't rely on me to troubleshoot it(I'll learn about it later).

Experience with open source systems is in installation and usage...most familiar with CentOS and Ubuntu, Apache, PHP and has a bit of knowledge in Qmail and MySQL. Virtualization experience is mostly in VMWare (the free version), Oracle VirtualBox and Parallels. Public cloud experience includes AWS, Rackspace Cloud, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean and of course Acquia for Drupal.

I don't hate Microsoft Windows but I just like a Unix-like system (and I run cygwin now and lately msys2) so I'm kinda at home with the CLI regardless of OS.

Since Mar 2019, I hold the following industry certifications:

- [CompTIA Linux+](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/930a39ef-db7a-4658-bf3d-52c717d7ff85)
- [LPIC-1: Linux Administrator](http://lpi.org/v/LPI000410499/cwztwt6lnb)
- [CompTIA Security+](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/0142b954-2449-41d5-9e97-1503f04d2457)

Been experimenting with [golang](https://go.dev/) lately and loving it :)
