      <description>June 21, 2021 is my official onboarding with Sprobe, Inc. As per my official designation, I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in a project that utilizes bash, awk and postgresql. Of course, it should be more than that but I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you much at this point.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently setting up my workstations which are all Windows 10. As I&amp;rsquo;m a heavy CLI user since my employment at GoAbroad, I tried installing MSYS2. I find it more convenient and flexible to install and use than Cygwin while I was working at Nokia Manila TC.</description>

      <description>A few days ago from this blog post, I got invited by a friend to join the Pi Network. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a cryptocurrency observer for quite some time and I have seen things come and go. I was a bit skeptical but at the same time curious of what it is. I activated Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s FREE WARP+ on my phone so I could be sure this is not something that&amp;rsquo;s hideous. So far, EVERYTHING checks out, so I joined.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve known The Internet Archive for more than a decade. Serves me a lot of times when references for difficult topics suffered some form of bit rot.
Simple to Use
Input the URL or domain like what you&amp;rsquo;ll do in Google or any search engine. Select what year and the circled dates in the calendar would point you to the archived page.
Example
Say for instance my former employer, Goabroad.com. I was there 2005 to early 2010 and I left traces in the robots.</description>

      <description>First week of August, I bought a Raspberry Pi in Lazada. Since it needs a keyboard and mouse and I don’t have one, I searched and bought as well. I selected one that’s unbranded and cheap since this is only for a hobby. I can always upgrade later if needed.
Below was the item I thought I was buying and getting: Fast forward to delivery day of the supposed keyboard and mouse, I only received one item: “mouse only”.</description>

      <title>USB Wireless Dongle that Works in Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>I had my first raspberry pi way back 2015 but I never get to use it. Back then, that single-board computer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a built-in wireless interface. Past forward 2020 and I bought a new PI on Lazada without checking on the specs&amp;hellip;so I got a wifi dongle as well.
My pi arrived first and after thoroughly reading the specs, I laughed at myself for buying something that I may never need.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Always HTTPS in Github Pages</title>

      <description>For those who knows how to look, this personal site of mine is hosted in Github Pages.
I have my notes in https://ismael.casimpan.com/quicktasks. Each individual quicktask is a repo (e.g https://github.com/icasimpan/quicktasks-drupal.git) with TravisCI integration that builds it.
However, I noticed that some of my quicktasks are not always https or is not redirected automatically. Look at the http headers for (QuickTask for Postfix)[http://ismael.casimpan.com/quicktasks-postfix] when accessing it without the protocol:
I never paid attention to those before, but today, I was curious as to why.</description>

      <title>IBM Buys RedHat</title>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s official: IBM is indeed buying RedHat. I&amp;rsquo;m an pro-Open Source and RedHat (and derivative OS such as CentOS) is my favorite but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything bad from it. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that the enterprise world that IBM represents some several decades ago is now taking in RedHat (a huge Open Source advocate AND backer) as it&amp;rsquo;s own.
Whether open source or closed source, any business would need to be in a good financial capacity in order to move forward.</description>

      <title>Liar vs Truthful Mail Server</title>

      <description>Once upon a time, when spam was not yet an &amp;ldquo;in thing&amp;rdquo;, mail servers where all truthful. A mail server that sends an email to another for a non-existing address always receives a notice from its peer that says &amp;ldquo;Sorry buddy, I can&amp;rsquo;t find it in my address list.&amp;rdquo; Years later, the demons(spammers) found out about sending junk mails or spam. So, the IT gods(email admin) brainstormed on how to contain the inbox chaos.</description>

      <title>Redirect Many URL to One URL in Apache</title>
      <link>/posts/redirect-many-url-to-one-url-in-apache/</link>

      <guid>/posts/redirect-many-url-to-one-url-in-apache/</guid>
      <description>I recently faced a situation wherein I have to permanently redirect a list of URLs to a single URL. I&amp;rsquo;m used to doing it for 1 to 1 redirects(1 url to another) but this is the first time I did it for a lot of URL.
Example:
 http://www.example.com/oldschool/index.php?i=1 http://www.example.com/oldschool/index.cfm?i=55 http://www.example.com/oldschool/SchoolOfRock.html http://www.example.com/oldschool/School-of-Knocks.htm  will need to be redirected to:
 http://www.example.com/university  The solution? Use the RedirectMatch directive in Apache. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use.</description>
